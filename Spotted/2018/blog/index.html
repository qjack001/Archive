        <h3>Ella's list of plants with a cohesive aesthetic</h3>
        <p><span class="date">June 25, 2019 - </span>Although I really enjoy collecting and experimenting with as many plant varieties as possible, I find the idea of curating a specific plant aesthetic for a house really interesting. I’ve pretty arbitrarily decided to stick with a maximum of 5 different plant species in my list, but I think this can be modified for different scenarios. Side note- while putting this together, I realized there are many factors to take into consideration when selecting a group of plants to suit a home’s aesthetic… so expect a few follow up posts. I’ve written down some considerations I thought about for this post, just to look back to when I come up with future ideas.

Considerations for a plant aesthetic:

  Max number of different species: 5
  How big is the space?
  What is the lighting situation?
  What is the architecture style, interior design situation, and general space feel?
  What is the climate?
  Try having a variety of plant forms- some trailing, some fixed, etc.
  Variety of foliage and foliage size
  Different plant sizes


Based off of these, I’ve tried creating a list as general as possible that I think would suit most climates, lighting, and design styles.

Plant #1: Pothos/devil’s ivy (Epipremnum aureum)



Pothos’s might be one of my favorite plants of all time. They make beautiful hanging curtains, can vine upwards, and will do well in pretty much any space. They will grow well in low light, but will flourish in higher light and grow large leaves. There are also many interesting varities that could be used to avoid to avoid too much repitition if the same plant is used multiple times in the same room. The plant will provide nice small to medium sized leaves, and highly dense foliage.


Pictured above: golden, pearl &amp; jade, and silver pothos. The climbing plant further above is a neon pothos!

Plant #2: Monstera plant/swiss cheese plant (Monstera deliciosa)



Monsteras are the dramatic, giant tropical plant everyone needs for their home. Like pothos, they are also fairly flexible in their light requirements, but they provide huge foliage more spaced out in the plant. It’s a great plant to place in a big pot on the floor or on a sturdy piece of furniture.

Plant #3: Staghorn fern or Bird’s nest fern (Platycerium or Asplenium nidus)

 

I know, I know… I said I’d narrow it down to 5. I just think both plants provide the same kind of aesthetic, so in the end you just choose one based on personal preference. Both staghorn ferns and bird’s next ferns provide some nice texture- without being a high maintenance fern that needs constant misting. They are also both on the smaller end if kept in medium pots, and would therefore fit nicely on a shelf, a desk, or any little corner that needs a plant. They provide a nice break from leaf based foliage and have varied frond shapes.

Plant #4: Fiddle-leaf fig (Ficus lyrata)



I deliberated quite a bit before including the fig plant, as they also have fairly large leaves, but I think it provides a nice balance considering how many tropical plants are on this list. Additionally, they are the only plant on here that can actually grow into a decently sized tree… and who doesn’t want a tree in their house? They’re also good with most light conditions, so I feel like its generally a pretty great plant to have (but considering it was one of my first plants, I’m a bit biased)


This is Summer Rayne’s fig plant, just to give you an idea on how big they can get! (Side note: a fiddle-leaf fig was also her first plant!)

Plant #5: “Baby rubber plant” (Peperomia obtusifolia)

 

I wasn’t quite sure what to include here… but given how many large plants I’ve included, I figured I should include something with smaller/compact leaves. I’ve recently really fallen in love with peperomias, and I think peperomia obtusifolia (also commonly known as the baby rubber plant, even though it’s not a rubber plant at all) has really nice shiny, dark green foliage. The plants would look nice in small pots scattered around a house. There’s some variegated varities if needed, and you can also get plants with slightly smaller/larger leaves. They are also pretty robust to most conditions, so I think they make a pretty good candidate for this list.

Honorable mentions: snake plant and philodendron (Sansevieria trifasciata and Philodendron bipinnatifidum)

It was pretty hard choosing a 5th plant… so I figured I’d include a few a deliberated over as well. I think any of these could make a good replacement of plant #5 on the list, depending on your personal taste. Snake plants are just so easy to grow, will tolerate so many conditions, and can come any size. Philodendrons are also great plants and come in lots of varieties, but I’ve omitted them just since they’re so similar to pothos (and I think pothos vines slightly better than philodendrons). That being said, you could easily just replace pothos with philodendron plants for the same effect, depending on your personal taste.

        <h3>Plant Propagation Videos</h3>
        <p><span class="date">September 08, 2018 - </span>As my obssesion with plants continues, I’ve realized the best alternative to spending all my money is learning how to propagate. Growing plants from seed is special, but for more immediate satisfaction- making plant cuttings is where it’s at.

I’ve discovered a niche of plant enthusiasts on the internet, and their dedication and excitement is very wholesome and has made watching plant videos my new favorite pasttime. Here is a compilation of some of the helpful youtube videos I’ve found so far:

Pothos propagation
Inspired Jack to propagate his own cuttings


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpmdo_0CZrU

This video gives you a good rundown on propagating basil. They give good tips on where to make cuttings, how to get it to root afterwards, and what to do with cuttings in general. (It’s also really satisfying because he shows the growth of all his basil plants over time lapse)

Propagating and collecting wild moss

I love this guys attitude and commentary. He’s crazy passionate about moss, and this video made me want to start my own little moss bed.

Hens and chicks

I used this to propgate my own hens and chicks- hopefully it holds up! This plant it similar to spider plants in that they produce their own clonal offspring, and all you have to do to propagate them is seperate the babies (“chicks”) from the mother plant.

        <h3>The Exquisite Orchid</h3>
        <p><span class="date">August 24, 2018 - </span>I’ve always thought of orchids as a delicate plant, but it is quite common to find wild ones on craggy rock faces and in patches of grass in Victoria, in particular the type pictured above. But despite copious research, I have been unable to identify the specific name of the ones I’v been seeing everywhere. However, this search led me down an internet rabbit hole-  and I learned quite a bit about orchids along the way.

Orchids in Canada

To my suprise, orchids are actually native to Canada (and  the rest of the world) from coast to coast, even being found in Ontario. They are definetly not just a tropical plant- although some of the most exciting varieties are only found in hot climates

The Singapore Orchid



The “Singapore Orchid” is an entire seperate class of orchids- fitting, as I’ve always associated the flower with Singapore. The countries national flower is a special orchid hybrid called Vanda Miss Joaquim, named after it’s breeder. It was the world’s first cultivated orchard hybrid.

Vanilla Orchids



There’s been a lot of talk of vanilla in the media lately as supplies have increasingly failed to meet demands. But why is this such a difficult spice to produce? Because the vanilla bean is actually coming from the pod from the vanilla orchid flower, and the fresh pod actually has no flavour- until it is steamed and fermented in a labor intensive process.

It is an extrememly difficult plant to cultivate, requiring many years of growth before ready to cultivate, and can only be grown in a specific range of climate. In the right hands, it can be grown in a greenhouse.

But who knew this extraordinarily important flavour came from an orchid?

Further Identification



Moth orchids are probably the class you are the most familiar as they are commonly sold at grocery stores. But there are hosts more of orchid species, as they are the largest family of flowering plants. If you are interested, here are a few good identification guides for reference:

        <h3>The Rise of the Bio-bots</h3>
        <p><span class="date">August 21, 2018 - </span>At first it was cashiers. Then truck drivers. Time and time again, we brushed it aside, “there will always be jobs,” we said. We were wrong.

When willrobotstakemyjob.com inched their predictions on the automation of computer programmers up to 48%, everything changed. Suddenly robots seemed destine to take over every job, not just the boring ones, but the important ones too (not even dancers were safe, for some reason?).

Anyone who managed to survive the Salt Wars of ‘33 will remember what happened next quite vividly. It was the summer of 2017 and for the first time, people had woken up. In a last ditch effort to fight back, Computer Programmers rallied together to march against the robots who dared steal their jobs. But it was simply too late.


  “We were the ones that made them, and we made them unstoppable.”


The year that followed was one of despair. Often referred to as “The Endless Winter” by todays historians, 2017 was a hard year for all of humanity. I remember waiting in line for food stamps in November. Everyday the line would grow longer as my fellow developers slowly got picked off one-by-one. The irony is that we were the ones that made them, and we made them unstoppable.

A Glimmer of Hope:

By the time summer had rolled around, humanity was on its last legs. Faced with its own obsoletion, humanity turned to the only thing it had left: the Verge.com. On July 12th, The Verge published a light-hearted piece entitled “This sun-chasing robot looks after the plant on its head”. In the face of true darkness, we had found light.



The article was a huge success, being widely regarded as one of the main events that catapulted Editor-in-Chief Nilay Patel into his run as Democratic Presidential Candidate in 2024. The article also helped kick-start Vincross, the company building these cute bots (note that this was back when Vincross was a mere startup, not the billion dollar military tech mogul we know and fear today).

The plant-bots sold like hot cakes, and soon nearly every home in Neo-America (simply called “North America” back then) had a one of these cute crawlers. And for a while humanity was safe; mildly distracted by a new toy, momentarily unaware of their inevitable fate.

2019:

On New Years Eve, Anderson Cooper accompanied by some forgettable co-host, took to the airways to broadcast the annual Ball-Drop in New York City. Anderson’s frosty breath is just barley noticeable by the camera, but it is a chilling foreshadowing to anyone looking back now. By the time February had rolled around it was clear something was different. Weather stations were running out of “COLDEST EVER” headlines, and the cold-snap’s fatality rate was quickly climbing. Believed to be most likely caused by climate change (this was back before climate change was proven to be a hoax), the winter of 2019 was the most deadly ever on record. And as we’d soon find out, not just for us humans.

You see when programming an AI, it can seem so tedious to have to explain to it what a plant is, and what the sun is, and how much sun is too much sun, and how much is too little. Instead, simply giving the machine a recognizable failure state allows it to learn how to prevent that state from ever occurring again. So the cute plant-headed robots in every American home was given one directive: avoid plant death.

When February’s frosts began to kill-off Vincross’s plant-bot’s plants, the bots took notice. Each death was converted to a data node and set through the network. With over 400 million bots online, it was only a matter of hours before they had found a solution.


  “One directive: avoid plant death.”


The Culling

At first the bots merely cut us out. Easily hacking into our energy plants, all power was diverted to large UV emitters that the bots could huddle around. Those that perished in the cold would be repurposed as compost in the Spring’s thaw. It wasn’t until humans began fighting back that the robots determined us a threat too.

Needless to say, we were an easy target. With humanity already crippled from the years before, the robots were swift in their genocide. After a futile few months, humanity accepted its defeat, retreating to the Tunnels.



And that brings us to today. With many veterans of the Bio-Bot Rise passing away, I fear our history may be lost. We must always reflect on our mistakes, as well as be thankful for what we have. Remember those who gave their lives so that our children could call the Tunnels “home”. And remember that there was a time before Bio-Bots were the dominate life form on Earth, and there will be a time after. May we one day see it.



This memoir was written to celebrate Tunnel Day 2053. For the original article, please find it on the Verge here

        <h3>3 Fun Websites About Plants</h3>
        <p><span class="date">August 17, 2018 - </span>Turns out there are more websites about plants than just this one. Surprising though, there seems to be a lack of well designed plant focused websites. Given that this site is obviously in 1st place, here are 3 other plant-sites that are also well designed.



1: The Sill

The Sill is a potted-plant retailer out of New York City. Their website serves as a digital marketplace, as well as offering plant-care guides. Check out their locations page for pictures of their store fronts. Speaking of well designed fronts, the website’s front-end is something to marvel at. The site has a simple but interesting logo animation as you scroll downs, and makes great use of Klim Type Foundery’s new Domaine typeface.





2: ELEVEN PLANTS FOR DUM-DUMS &amp; COOL PPL

This experimental website is the latest created by Drew Marshall which, although uses plants as a focus, is actually about fonts. I know, I’m in heaven. “ELEVEN PLANTS FOR DUM-DUMS &amp; COOL PPL” displays 11 plants, each with its own font pairings and design. There is quite a bit of animation, as well as a little bit of custom type. Overall a very aesthetically pleasing, as well as aesthetically diverse website.





3: Richters Herbs

The OG plant-site is hosted at the coveted herbs.com (not to be confused with herb.co, a well designed website focusing on just one plant in particular). The design of the site hasn’t really changed since 2011, and has always maintained a relatively consistent style since its creation in 1996. The reason for this is because there really isn’t much room for improvement. The site pairs a few different weights of Arial, a typeface by Monotype that’s design can be traced back to Haas Grotesk. The typeface is timeless in its simplicity, and is beautifully shown off on a variety of green backgrounds (such as #8b4, #A4C973, and #123108) that have honestly not changed over 20 years.

Nothing to add a bit of mexican flavor to your life like adding these succulents to your lawn. With your newfound wordliness, you may finally be able to handle the ‘muy picante’ salsa at chipotle.

There’s lots more alternatives to grass- for something much simpler, check out this guide to maintaining a moss lawn. They are an excellent choice if you are looking to cut down on maintenance and water use, or if you’ve always wanted to transform your backyard into a meditation space.

Good luck and enjoy your new jazzy lawn.

Some stupidly big leaves in the back of this dense garden:



Cool idea for a house facade:

        <h3>Moroccan Cactus Garden</h3>
        <p><span class="date">August 09, 2018 - </span>I thought I’d share a few of my favorite plant pictures from Morocco, since spotted is where they should have gone. The majority come from le Jardin Majorelle, an agressively exotic cactus garden that was bought and restored by Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé in 1980, who found the place to be a major art inspiration. I’d agree:



Park Entrance

Upon entering you are greeted by cacti over 5 meters tall.



Followed by giant succulents the size of a bush.



It was funny, because it had the landscaping of an ornate rose garden, but instead filled with cacti.




Winning shots

Here’s what I’d consider my best photos from the trip. The colors and textures were very aesthetically pleasing.
